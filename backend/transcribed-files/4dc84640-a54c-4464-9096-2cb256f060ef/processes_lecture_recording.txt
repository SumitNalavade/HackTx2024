let's try to understand better the differences between a process and a threat to recap from the previous lessons a single-threaded process is represented by its address space the address space will contain all of the virtual to physical address mappings for the process for its code its data heat section files for everything the process is also represented by its execution context that contains information about the values of the registers the stack pointer program counter etcetera the operating system represents all this information in a process control block threads we said represent multiple independent execution contacts they're part of the same virtual address space which means that they will share all of the virtual to physical address mappings they will share all the code data files however they will potentially execute different instructions access different portions of that address space operate on different portions of the input in different other ways this means that each thread will need to have a different program counter stack pointer stacked specific registers so we will have for each and every threat we will have to have separate data structures to represent this per threat information the operating system representation of such a multithreaded process will be a more complex process control block structure than what we saw before this will contain all of the information that shared among all the threats so the virtual address mappings description about the code and data set alarm and it will also have separate information about every single one of the execution contacts that are part of that process
